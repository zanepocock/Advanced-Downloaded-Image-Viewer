# Advanced-Downloaded-Image-Viewer
Completed for Dr. Schmidt's 2015 Android Concurrency MOOC

The goal of this assignment was to develop an app that prompts the user for a URL to an image and then download the image, filter the image, and view it.

Downloading the image and filtering the image was performed via two different instances of the Android AsyncTask concurrency framework.

The app handles runtime configuration changes properly in the context of concurrently executing instances of AsyncTask.
